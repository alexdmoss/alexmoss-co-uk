http://moss.work is - on the surface at least - a website describing the career
of Alex Moss.

Alex works in IT as a Cloud Architect for the John Lewis Partnership,
a major retailer in the UK - having previously held roles as a Platform
Engineer looking after the hosting for a number of enterprise technologies,
including those underpinning www.johnlewis.com.

In truth, this website exists to serve as a way to experiment with cloud
automation technologies using a very simple web application, supported through
a DevOps toolchain and deployed to Google's Cloud Platform. For more
information on this, see [The Tech Stack](TechStack.md), which describes what's
going on under the hood.
