I'm a strong advocate of modern approaches such as microservice architecture, well-versed in the modernisation of legacy technologies, and capable of leading the technical design for a solution's infrastructure build & deployment.

As an architect, I have:

- Cultivated a reputation as an expert in Cloud technologies. I'm approached across my employer for my thought-leadership in this area.
- Championed Continuous Delivery & Automation. I am a firm believer in "you build it, you run it", including giving teams powerful tools to make this a reality.
- Considerable experience designing for resilience and security, including through evolutionary design & experimentation. I believe that to be a good architect you must know the real capabilities of the technologies you're driving - not just what it says on the tin.

I've also played a significant role in setting infrastructure strategy - technical design, patterns and governance - particularly for Cloud.
