I was fortunate enough to study Chemistry at St Edmund Hall College, Oxford - where I achieved a 1st Class Honours degree. I spent my final year producing a thesis in Computational Chemistry - where I developed a Neural Network in Java (Java 1.4 at the time!) to analyse and predict the contents of oil spills based on spectrographic data.

It was while there that it became clear that a career in IT was the path I wanted to take. It start whilst serving as my college's 'IT Officer' - a role that involved creating the college's student website and being a generally helping hand in fixing the variety of computer-related problems!

Since leaving education, I've chosen not to build up a long list of formal qualifications. Instead I strongly favour learning through hands-on experience & experimentation, as well as building insight through conferences & meetups.
