I am an experienced and motivated IT professional who enjoys seeing the bigger picture and enthusiastically applying it to solutions both small and large.

I am always looking to take on fresh challenges involving modern platforms. My current areas of interest include infrastructure strategy (and in particular cloud architectures), platform engineering, and automation.

I'm passionate about working with modern technology and quick to pick up new areas, fueled by a proven record in leading large-scale infrastructure implementations.
