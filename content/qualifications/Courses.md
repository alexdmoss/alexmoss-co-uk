I have always favoured learning through hands-on experience & experimentation, as well as building insight through conferences & meetups. Most recently, I was lucky enough to attend Googleâ€™s Next 2018 Conference in San Francisco to represent JLP technically, at the request of my Director.

That said, I have also taken part in several personal development courses and conferences through my time in John Lewis, including those on Agile, Managing Third Parties, and Leadership Skills.
