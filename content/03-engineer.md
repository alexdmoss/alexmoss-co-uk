I'm inspired by working with modern technology and love to combine a hands-on role with championing technologies and techniques to others.

I'm the Engineering Lead and domain specialist for the Digital Platform for a large UK retailer, and love solving complex problems using cutting edge tech that has broad application across many services and engineers.

As an engineer, I love:

- Docker & Kubernetes - it was the platform I wish I'd had sooner; finding a perfect sweet spot between software agility and operational control.
- Cloud Platforms - I'm most familiar with Google Cloud, and I think it is awesome.
- Automation & Continuous Delivery. Technologies that struggle with this are not something I like.
