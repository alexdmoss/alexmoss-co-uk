#### Platform Engineer - johnlewis.com Cloud Platform, 2017+

One of the founding members of the team that has built the first large-scale cloud platform in John Lewis. Nominally an Architecture role, in reality this is a cross-functional team and I was able to get my hands dirty early on and through to implementation, including being on call for the launch.

The work involved migrating the frontend of johnlewis.com to Google Cloud (Docker/Kubernetes with all the trimmings). It now serves as the foundational platform for an emerging new microservice architecture that underpins the whole JL Digital portfolio.

Through hands-on engineering I got to experience modern cloud and automation techniques such as CI/CD, infrastructure as code, Docker and Kubernetes, as well as the PaaS capabilities within Google Cloud.

It is fantastic to be able to work with cutting edge technology - sometimes directly with Google themselves - in a leading area of our business.

#### Technical Lead, New E-Commerce Platform, John Lewis IT, 2016-2017

In parallel to an Architecture role, acted as Technical Lead for the migration of the johnlewis.com e-Commerce platform to a new on-premise private cloud infrastructure. This work was abandoned for financial reasons - a blessing in disguise as it accelerated our adoption of cloud (the role above!).

Whilst in this post I was involved in constructing a detailed design for the new solution, as well as overseeing its technical implementation - including engineering disciplines that were new to this part of the organisation - such as continuous delivery of infrastructure to support faster change, as well as improved reliability for operations through automation.
