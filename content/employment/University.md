I was fortunate enough to study Chemistry at St Edmund Hall College, Oxford. It was while there that it became clear that a career in IT was the path I wanted to take.

During my time I served as my college's 'IT Officer' - a role that involved maintaining the college's website and being a generally helping hand in fixing the variety of computer-related problems that popped up while at college - usually involving students' broken laptops!

It was in this role that I first developed my interest in taking on a job in IT permanently - I got a great deal of satisfaction out of creating and building an improved version of the college's website, which I wrote in PHP and used as a way to provide students with all sorts of useful tools that hadn't typically been available through a website before - simple things like booking tickets or viewing the food menu!

I also spent the final year of my degree on a thesis in Computational Chemistry - where I developed a Neural Network in Java (Java 1.4 at the time!) to analyse and predict the contents of oil spills based on spectrographic data (and it worked!).
