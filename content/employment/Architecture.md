#### Cloud Architect, John Lewis Partnership IT, 2017+

This is a newly created role working across the John Lewis Partnership - but with an initial focus on John Lewis e-Commerce - focused on driving Cloud Adoption and Continuous Delivery. 

Key elements of the role include:
- building a pan-Partnership Cloud Strategy and ensuring it remains relevant as the industry evolves and our needs change, including establishing clear principles and standards to maximise value and ensure that services are strategically sound
- defining and maintaining a framework within which DevOps and Software Engineering teams can operate freely and securely

As a new and dynamic area, there will be a number of hands-on elements to the work which I am greatly looking forward to. There will be a need to technically assure our cloud adoption trials, and also in the embedding of DevOps practices and toolchains. This will also help establish Architecture as a trusted and valuable adviser and partner to the wider IT community.

I am very much looking forward to taking this on at an exciting time of significant growth in this area for JLP.

#### Technical Infrastructure Architect, John Lewis IT, 2015-2017

Part of a small team who shape the IT infrastructure strategy for John Lewis. Includes exploitation of existing on-premise technologies, exploring newer initiatives such as Cloud Computing and DevOps, and advising other architects and engineers on our capabilities and areas of opportunity.

This comprised both Enterprise & Solution Architecture functions - allowing me to see our technologies put to use, whilst also building relationships with business and IT stakeholders, understanding the challenges they faced and how they can be supported through technology.

I have a particular eye for driving automation and standardisation, ensuring that both the infrastructure and the way it is managed can efficiently scale. I've also had a hand in many performance and availability initiatives for the bigger programmes of work.
