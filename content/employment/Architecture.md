#### Platform Architect - Cloud Adoption & Continuous Delivery, Partnership IT, 2017+

This was at the time a newly created role working across the John Lewis Partnership - but with an initial focus on John Lewis e-Commerce - focused on driving Cloud Adoption and Continuous Delivery.

As the sole Cloud Architect, I was instrumental in building the pan-Partnership Cloud Strategy and continue to ensure it remains relevant as the industry evolves and our needs change, including establishing clear principles and standards to maximise value and ensure that services are strategically sound.

I was able to do this effectively through being directly embedded within the newly formed platforms team within the johnlewis.com area. I was instrumental in shaping and driving its adoption, whilst also maintaining a level of hands-on exposure as the role allows to I think my team would agree helped steer the platform towards a successful outcome.

As part of this team, I was able to practice Agile & Lean techniques such as Continuous Improvement & Kanban, as well as adopt new practices such as Evolutionary Design, then champion these back into the architectural community. I also wrote the Partnership's formative Cloud Strategy while in this role.

The role has now evolved into a Platforms Architect across two teams - the second created in response to demand for frictionless onboarding & maturing of the platform’s “paved road”.

#### Technical Infrastructure Architect, John Lewis IT, 2015-2017

Before that, I was part of a small team who shaped the IT infrastructure strategy for John Lewis. This included exploitation of existing on-premise technologies, exploring newer initiatives such as Cloud Computing and DevOps, and advising other architects and engineers on our capabilities and areas of opportunity.

In contrast to other architectural domains in John Lewis, this role comprised both Enterprise & Solution Architecture functions - allowing me to see our technologies put to use, whilst also building relationships with business and IT stakeholders, understanding the challenges they faced and how they can be supported through technology. I believe this worked really well for the role.
