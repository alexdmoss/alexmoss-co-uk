Introduction:

moss.work is - on the surface at least - a website describing the career of
Alex Moss.

In truth, it serves as a way to experiment with cloud automation technologies
by using a very simple application.

The technology stack consists of:
- A simple Gitbook for maintaining the site's content
- A dockerised image for localised build and testing
- The docker image is then published to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on
Google's Cloud Platform
